# InClass2_Exercise

This project consists of solutions to all 4 In-Class Assignments required for week 2 of the course - ISM6225 of USF

In-class: API consumption
Include capabilities in your project to pull data from an API. While you can use any API, it is highly recommended that you use an API from the data.gov site. These APIs are simple, and have mostly text data. However, they are less likely to require you to jump through hoops to get access.
You may create a new project, or just extend your current project. Push the project to Github and submit the URL to the repository.

In-class: Html links in views
Update your MVC project to include a html link to an action method in a view. Include your team members as collaborators to your project and synchronize changes from all team members into your project. Submit the url to your GitHub repository.
In this activity, you will explore the team collaboration capabilities of modern version control systems.

In-class: Razor form
Create a MVC project, or update your existing MVC project to include a simple form that accepts user inputs and processes the inputs in the action method upon form submission. Push the project to GitHub. Submit the url to your repository.

In-class: Cloud deployment
Deploy your project to the cloud. You may deploy the project to any cloud environment you prefer, however, Azure is likely to be the simplest, given its tight integration with Visual Studio. Submit a link to your web application running on the cloud provider (an Azure, the url will be something like sp20app.azurewebsites.net). To minimize the use of your credits, please stop your application as soon as it is graded.

The App Service deployed in Azure for this exercise is:
